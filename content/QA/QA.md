# Questions and Answers

## Application field

### Q: Can SnpHub be applied to other species?

A: Yes! SnpHub can be applied to any specie (both plant or animal) as long as the variation data is provided in `VCF format` or `.hapmap format`. 

## Input/Output formats

### Q: Does SnpHub support to use SNP array data (usually in `.hapmap` format) as input (instead of VCF format)?

A: Yes, SnpHub accept the variantion data in format of both VCF format (generated by re-sequencing, genotyping-by-sequencing or whole-genome exome capture sequencing) and hapmap formats (generated by microarray). To support the hapmap format, set the option `data_type` in the configuration file `setup.conf` as `hapmap`. Also, provide the path to your `.hapmap` files for the `path_hapmap` option.
