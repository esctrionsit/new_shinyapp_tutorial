# Overview

As Docker is a convenient way to setup the software environment, we also provide a more easier way to use `SnpHub` based on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

To setup `Snphub` using `Docker`, you need to **install** `Docker` on your server first.

Also, `samtools`, along with `bcftools`, `tabix` and `seqkit` still need to **be installed** in order to pre-process your data.
