# Haplotype plot

![](./../img/NGBT-haplotype.jpg)

Haplotype plot provides a more clear way to analyze mutation type through different samples.

## Panel ① on the left provides severial options:
- **Groups**: different from `variation subset`, samples here need to be divided into no less than 1 group. `Group1{sample1,sample2}` is a sample of **temporary group**, in which `Group1` is the name of the group, and sample labels in the curly brackets they are contained in the group.`Group1{sample1,sample2},Group2{sample3,sample4}` is a example for multiple groups. **Also**, you can use the pre-defined groups showen in the `About` tag. It's **NO** need to add hash here, because the input here is **group** instead of **plain samples**. **Make sure** that a sample won't appear more than once.

- **Regions**: same as `variation subset`.

- **Extra length before AND after the regions (bp)**: same as `variation subset`.

- **Draw**: click after fulfill options, and panel ② will display the plot (if every settings are correct).

If everything goes smoothly, and the plot displayed, then there will be a "done" here. But, if some options goes wrong, there might be some short error message here to help fixing it. **Mostly**, recheck the input of options is useful.
