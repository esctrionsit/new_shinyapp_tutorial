# Quick start

You can download our source code from [Github](github.com), and:
- if you downloaded it to a server, put the folder into shiny app directory. If you hadn't install the shiny server, see [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/).
- if you download to a PC, you can use the `cd` command of the shell into our source code root path, then open R. R code below shows how to temporary run a shiny app. For more information, see [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/running.html) or [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson1/).

```R
library(shiny)
runApp()
```

Our source on Github already have a test data set. If the system environment is well configurated, you could already get start with it.
