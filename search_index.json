By clicking them, the content will switch to the tagged function.\n③: Content. Here is the main panel where you actually use the application.\n\nIn the part of tags, as you can see, there're 6 of them that can be clicked. The current displayed tag is marked by a light shadow. In the picture, it's the About tag that is selected by now, and it looks slightly different to others.\nWe will talk about more details in the later tutorial.\n"},"content/Basic_Usage/about.html":{"url":"content/Basic_Usage/about.html","title":"About","keywords":"","body":"1.

Different names should be splited by comma, like Sample1,Sample2. If you want to use group, put a hash before it, likeSample1,Sample2,#Group1. Make sure that samples only appear ONCE in totall.\n\nSamples that DO HAVE mutations: samples here will be asked to have mutations in the result. If they donnot have in some postion, these postion won't appear.\nSamples that MUST NOT HAVE mutations: contrary to the former, postions which samples here have mutations will be deleted. So that samples here won't appear to have mutations in the result.\nSamples without filtering: samples here won't be dealed, just display.\n\n\n\n\nRegions: input wanted region, with the format CHROM:BEGIN-END, or gene name. Like the samples, when you want more than one region, use comma to split.\n\nExtra length before AND after the regions (bp): sometime when you want to use the gene name as region, you want some extra postions in the upstream or downstream. Value here is simply added to the maximum of each region, and subtracted from the minimum of each region.\n\nAdvanced Options: click this button to show/hide some advanced options. Note that when these options are hide, they won't affect the result.\n\n\n1.2. Advanced Options\n\nClick the button Advanced Options, and then some more options appeared.Note that when these options are hide, they won't affect the result.\n\nMAF filtering threshold (0 for disable): Minor allele frequency (MAF) is the frequency at which the second most common allele occurs in a given population. Larger the value is, lesser the result postions are. If the value is 0 (by default), this filter function is disabled.\n\nBiallelic sites only: A biallelic site is a specific locus in a genome that contains two observed alleles, counting the reference as one, and therefore allowing for one variant allele. A multiallelic site is a specific locus in a genome that contains three or more observed alleles, again counting the reference as one, and therefore allowing for two or more variant alleles. Select Yes, all postions in the result that have multiallelic will be deleted.\n\nMaxium of missing rate (1 for disable filtering): Lesser the value is, lesser the results are.\n\n\n1.3. RUN, and Download\nClick the Run button when get all options ready. Table on the right will show the result of subsetting, or some error message if the input isn't correct.\nClick Download as csv to download current result on the right in format csv.\nClick\n"},"content/Basic_Usage/haplotype.html":{"url":"content/Basic_Usage/haplotype.html","title":"Haplotype plot","keywords":"","body":"1.
