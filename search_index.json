By clicking them, the content will switch to the tagged function.\n③: Content. Here is the main panel where you actually use the application.\n\nIn the part of tags, as you can see, there're 6 of them that can be clicked. The current displayed tag is marked by a light shadow. In the picture, it's the About tag that is selected by now, and it looks slightly different to others.\nWe will talk about more details in the later tutorial.\n"},"content/Basic_Usage/about.html":{"url":"content/Basic_Usage/about.html","title":"About","keywords":"","body":"1.

Part Ⅱ shows all the avaliable chromosomes, by their name and length. Part Ⅲ shows all the groups pre-defined by your adminsitrator. First column is the name of groups, and second is the labels of samples belong to it.\nAll these 3 tables can be searched (right upper) or filtered (top of each column).\nWhen you forget what to input, nor how to input, check here.\n"},"content/Basic_Usage/subset.html":{"url":"content/Basic_Usage/subset.html","title":"variation subset","keywords":"","body":"1. variation subset1.1.

The Left one, Ⅰ, is the input zone, while the right part is the result display zone.\nThis function subset the VCF file by the requirements given in the left (part Ⅰ), and shows the child collection on the right (part Ⅱ).\nNote that all the conditions are connected by logic AND (&&)\n1.1. There are several inputs on the left:\n\nVariation Type: select one of the three ratios that represent SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) only, indel (input/delete) only or snp + indel.\n\nSamples: in the three text inputs, you can either use labels of single sample, or groups. Different names should be splited by comma, like Sample1,Sample2. If you want to use group, put a hash before it, likeSample1,Sample2,#Group1. Make sure that samples only appear ONCE in totall.\n\nSamples that DO HAVE mutations: samples here will be asked to have mutations in the result. If they donnot have in some postion, these postion won't appear.\nSamples that MUST NOT HAVE mutations: contrary to the former, postions which samples here have mutations will be deleted. So that samples here won't appear to have mutations in the result.\nSamples without filtering: samples here won't be dealed, just display.\n\n\n\n\nRegions: input wanted region, with the format CHROM:BEGIN-END, or gene name. Like the samples, when you want more than one region, use comma to split.\n\nExtra length before AND after the regions (bp): sometime when you want to use the gene name as region, you want some extra postions in the upstream or downstream. Value here is simply added to the maximum of each region, and subtracted from the minimum of each region.\n\nAdvanced Options: click this button to show/hide some advanced options. Note that when these options are hide, they won't affect the result.\n\n\n1.2. Advanced Options\n\nClick the button Advanced Options, and then some more options appeared.Note that when these options are hide, they won't affect the result.\n\nMAF filtering threshold (0 for disable): Minor allele frequency (MAF) is the frequency at which the second most common allele occurs in a given population. Larger the value is, lesser the result postions are. If the value is 0 (by default), this filter function is disabled.\n\nBiallelic sites only: A biallelic site is a specific locus in a genome that contains two observed alleles, counting the reference as one, and therefore allowing for one variant allele. A multiallelic site is a specific locus in a genome that contains three or more observed alleles, again counting the reference as one, and therefore allowing for two or more variant alleles. Select Yes, all postions in the result that have multiallelic will be deleted.\n\nMaxium of missing rate (1 for disable filtering): Lesser the value is, lesser the results are.\n\n\n1.3. RUN, and Download\nClick the Run button when get all options ready. Table on the right will show the result of subsetting, or some error message if the input isn't correct.\nClick Download as csv to download current result on the right in format csv.\nClick\n"},"content/Basic_Usage/haplotype.html":{"url":"content/Basic_Usage/haplotype.html","title":"Haplotype plot","keywords":"","body":"1.

Also, you can use the pre-defined groups showen in the About tag. It's NO need to add hash here, because the input here is group instead of plain samples. Make sure that a sample won't appear more than once.\n\nRegions: same as variation subset.\n\nExtra length before AND after the regions (bp): same as variation subset.\n\nDraw: click after fulfill options, and panel ② will display the plot (if every settings are correct).\n\n\n1.2.
